5,"Bought this DSLR on Big billion sale. Very happy with the performence through 18-55 stm lens. Some sample photos which I have transferred to my mobile, are attached here. I am extremely happy with its low light performance. All the photos here are unedited. I was bit confused between M50 and 200d mark II but atlast choosed the later one for its wide variety of lens options.READ MORE",Must buy!,SNEHASIS KARMAKAR
